/*Write a Java program that demonstrates the concept of a function returning another
function using Javaâ€™s Function interface. Define a method that returns a lambda
function that takes an integer as input and returns its square. In the main method,
retrieve the returned function and use it to calculate and display the squares of different
numbers.
